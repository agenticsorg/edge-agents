# Edge Function Categories

This document provides an overview of the different categories of edge functions available in the repository. Each category serves a specific purpose and contains functions designed for particular use cases.

## Agent Functions

Agent functions implement autonomous agents that can reason, make decisions, and take actions. These functions use large language models and other AI technologies to provide intelligent behavior.

- [Agent Alpha](./agent_functions/agent_alpha.md): A foundational agent implementation using the ReAct pattern
- Agent Beta: An enhanced agent with improved reasoning capabilities
- Agent Stream: An agent implementation with streaming response support
- Agent WebSocket: An agent implementation with WebSocket support for real-time interaction
- Agentic Inbox Agent: An agent for managing and processing inbox messages

## Management Functions

Management functions provide tools for orchestrating and managing other functions, agents, and resources. They handle coordination, monitoring, and lifecycle management.

- [Agent Manager](./management_functions/agent-manager.md): A centralized system for managing multiple agents
- Edge Deployment: A function for deploying and managing edge functions
- Meta Function Generator: A function for generating new functions based on templates

## Communication Functions

Communication functions enable various forms of communication between systems, users, and external services. They handle messaging, notifications, and data exchange.

- [Resend](./communication_functions/resend.md): Email communication using the Resend API
- Send Contact Notification: Sends notifications for contact form submissions
- Feedback: Processes and routes user feedback

## Integration Functions

Integration functions connect edge functions with external services and APIs. They provide bridges to various platforms and systems.

- [GitHub API](./integration_functions/github-api.md): Integration with the GitHub API
- MCP Server: Model Context Protocol server for extending agent capabilities
- Stripe Check Subscription Status: Integration with subscription management services
- Stripe Create Portal Session: Integration with payment and subscription portals

## Utility Functions

Utility functions provide common tools and helpers that can be used by other functions. They handle cross-cutting concerns and reusable functionality.

- [Environment Test](./utility_functions/env_test.md): Utility for verifying environment variable configuration
- Hello World: A simple example function for testing and demonstration
- Test Function: A function for testing edge function deployment and execution
- CORS: Utilities for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

## Function Development Guidelines

When developing new functions, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Categorization**: Place your function in the appropriate category based on its primary purpose
2. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for your function following the templates
3. **Testing**: Include tests for your function to ensure reliability
4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for all possible failure scenarios
5. **Security**: Follow security best practices, especially for handling sensitive data
6. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for configuration and secrets
7. **CORS Support**: Include CORS headers for functions that will be called from browsers
8. **Logging**: Implement appropriate logging for debugging and monitoring

## Creating a New Function

To create a new function:

1. Identify the appropriate category for your function
2. Create a new directory in the corresponding category directory
3. Implement your function following the [contributing guidelines](./contributing.md)
4. Create documentation for your function following the category templates
5. Test your function thoroughly
6. Deploy your function using the deployment guidelines

## Function Structure

Each function should follow a consistent structure:

```
supabase/functions/function-name/
├── index.ts          # Main function implementation
├── deno.json         # Deno configuration (if needed)
├── import_map.json   # Import map (if needed)
├── README.md         # Function-specific documentation
└── ...               # Additional files as needed
```

## Documentation Structure

Each function's documentation should include:

1. **Overview**: A brief description of the function's purpose
2. **Architecture**: How the function is structured and how it works
3. **Features**: Key capabilities of the function
4. **Implementation Details**: Technical details about how the function is implemented
5. **Configuration**: How to configure the function, including environment variables
6. **Usage**: How to use the function, including request and response formats
7. **Error Handling**: How the function handles errors
8. **Deployment**: How to deploy the function
9. **Testing**: How to test the function
10. **Security Considerations**: Security aspects to be aware of
11. **Limitations**: Any limitations or constraints of the function
12. **Integration**: How the function can be integrated with other functions or systems
