# Agentic Edge Functions Tutorials

Welcome to the Agentic Edge Functions tutorials! This section provides beginner-friendly guides to help you understand, create, and deploy your own edge functions for the Agentic Foundation Dashboard and Agentic Inbox.

## What Are Agentic Edge Functions?

Agentic Edge Functions are serverless functions that run at the edge of the network, providing autonomous agent capabilities through a simple API interface. These functions enable you to create intelligent agents that can reason, take actions, and interact with users and external systems.
