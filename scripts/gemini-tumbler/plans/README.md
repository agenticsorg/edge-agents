## Project Overview

The Gemini Tumbler project aims to create a service that:

1. **Rotates Between Models**: Automatically switches between different Gemini models based on configurable intervals
2. **Provides Anonymous Contributions**: Allows users to contribute their prompts and responses anonymously for model improvement
3. **Offers a RESTful API**: Provides a clean API for interacting with the service
4. **Deploys as an Edge Function**: Optimized for deployment in edge environments for low-latency access

## Key Features

- Model rotation with configurable intervals
- Anonymous contribution system with privacy protections
- RESTful API for service interaction
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Performance optimization for edge environments
- Integration with MCP for enhanced control and monitoring

## Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Deno
- **API Framework**: Oak
- **Testing**: Deno's built-in testing framework
- **Deployment**: Edge function platforms
- **Integration**: MCP system

## Development Approach

The project follows the SPARC methodology:

1. **Specification**: Define clear requirements and objectives
2. **Planning**: Create detailed implementation plans
3. **Architecture**: Design a robust and scalable architecture
4. **Refinement**: Continuously improve the implementation
5. **Completion**: Deliver a high-quality, well-tested product

## Getting Started

To begin development:

1. Review the implementation phases document to understand the development roadmap
