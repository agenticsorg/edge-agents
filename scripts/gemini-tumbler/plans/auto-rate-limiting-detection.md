# Auto-Detection of API Rate Limiting and Dynamic Rate Adjustment

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of an intelligent rate limiting detection and automatic adjustment system for the Gemini Tumbler service. The system will dynamically monitor API responses across multiple providers and keys, detect rate limiting patterns, and automatically adjust request distribution to maximize throughput while preventing rate limit errors.

## Problem Statement

When using multiple API keys across different AI providers, each with their own rate limiting policies:

1. Different providers have different rate limiting mechanisms and error responses
2. Rate limits can change without notice based on provider policies
3. Some providers use hard limits while others use sliding window limits
4. Manual management of rate limits becomes impractical at scale
5. Naive rate limiting wastes available capacity

## Goals

1. Automatically detect rate limiting behavior across all providers
2. Dynamically adjust request rates per API key to maximize throughput
3. Implement fair load distribution across multiple keys
4. Provide metrics and visibility into rate limit usage
5. Self-heal during rate limiting incidents without service disruption

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Monitoring and Detection

#### 1. Response Monitoring System

- Implement a response interceptor for all API requests
- Track response times, status codes, headers, and error messages
- Maintain a time-series database of response metrics per API key
- Analyze patterns to detect rate limiting signatures

#### 2. Rate Limit Detection Strategies

- **Error Code Analysis**: Detect provider-specific rate limit error codes
  - Google AI: 429 Too Many Requests 
  - OpenAI: 429 with "rate_limit_exceeded" error type
  - Anthropic: 429 with specific error messages
  
- **Header Monitoring**: Track rate limit headers
  - `X-RateLimit-Limit`
  - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`
  - `X-RateLimit-Reset`
  - Provider-specific headers
  
- **Response Timing Analysis**: Detect patterns indicating throttling
  - Sudden increase in response times
  - Consistent delays matching known backoff patterns
  
- **Machine Learning Model**: Train a model to detect subtle rate limiting
  - Use supervised learning on labeled rate-limited responses
  - Feature extraction from response metadata
  - Real-time classification of borderline cases

### Phase 2: Dynamic Rate Adjustment

#### 1. Rate Limit Model

- Implement provider-specific rate limit models:
  - Requests per minute (RPM)
  - Requests per day (RPD)
  - Tokens per minute (TPM)
  - Concurrent requests limit
  
- Build a time-based sliding window for each metric
- Account for different scopes (global, per-model, per-key)

#### 2. Adaptive Request Distribution

- Implement an adaptive token bucket algorithm per API key
- Dynamically adjust token refill rates based on observed limits
- Apply exponential backoff when rate limits are hit
- Implement fair queuing across multiple consumers

#### 3. Load Balancing Strategies

- **Round Robin with Health Awareness**: Skip keys approaching limits
- **Least Utilized First**: Route to keys with most remaining capacity
- **Predictive Routing**: Use time-series forecasting to predict key availability
- **Capability-Based Routing**: Balance between specialized and general models

### Phase 3: Self-Optimization

#### 1. Continuous Learning System

- Implement feedback loop from actual usage patterns
- Adjust internal rate limit models based on observed behavior
- Build provider-specific profiles of rate limiting behaviors
- Automatically adapt to changing provider policies

#### 2. Anomaly Detection and Healing

- Detect sudden changes in rate limiting behavior
- Automatically isolate and test affected keys/providers
- Redistribute load during anomalies
- Gradually reintroduce recovered resources

#### 3. Cost-Optimized Distribution

- Balance load based on cost efficiency metrics
- Optimize for free tier usage across providers
- Implement time-based strategies (e.g., regenerate quotas at specific times)
- Balance between throughput and cost objectives
