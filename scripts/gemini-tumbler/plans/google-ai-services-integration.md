# Google AI Services Integration Plan

This document outlines the plan to extend Gemini Tumbler to support additional Google AI services beyond the current Gemini API implementation.

## Overview

Google offers several AI services with free tiers that can be integrated into our platform to provide a more comprehensive set of capabilities. By implementing a unified interface for these services, we can offer users access to a wider range of AI functionalities while maintaining the benefits of our key rotation and load balancing features.

## Services to Integrate

### 1. Vertex AI (High Priority)

**Description**: Google's unified ML platform that includes Gemini models and other specialized AI services.

**Implementation Plan**:
- Create a `VertexAIClient` class implementing our common interface
- Support authentication via service accounts and API keys
- Implement model discovery and parameter configuration
- Add support for multimodal inputs (text, images, etc.)

**Free Tier Benefits**:
- Access to additional model variants
- Higher rate limits in some cases
- Enterprise-grade reliability

### 2. Document AI (Medium Priority)

**Description**: Specialized service for document processing, OCR, and form parsing.

**Implementation Plan**:
- Create a `DocumentAIClient` class
- Implement document upload and processing methods
- Add specialized response parsers for structured data extraction
- Integrate with the tumbler service for document-specific workflows

**Free Tier Benefits**:
- Limited document processing capabilities
- Specialized OCR and form extraction features
- Complementary to text generation services

### 3. Google Cloud Natural Language API (Medium Priority)

**Description**: Specialized NLP services for entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and content classification.

**Implementation Plan**:
- Create a `NaturalLanguageClient` class
- Implement methods for each analysis type
- Add result caching to optimize quota usage
- Integrate with the tumbler for enhanced text analysis

**Free Tier Benefits**:
- 5,000 units of text analysis per month
- Specialized NLP capabilities beyond general LLMs
- Structured data outputs for specific use cases

### 4. Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech (Low Priority)

**Description**: Voice processing services for transcription and audio generation.

**Implementation Plan**:
- Create `SpeechToTextClient` and `TextToSpeechClient` classes
- Implement audio file handling and streaming capabilities
- Add voice selection and audio format options
- Integrate with the tumbler for multimodal workflows

**Free Tier Benefits**:
- Limited minutes of audio processing per month
- Multiple voices and languages
- High-quality audio generation

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Common Interface

Create a base `GoogleAIClient` interface that all service implementations will follow:

```typescript
interface GoogleAIClient<InputType, OutputType> {
  process(input: InputType, options?: any): Promise<OutputType>;
  getCapabilities(): string[];
  getUsageLimits(): UsageLimits;
  setParameters(params: Record<string, any>): void;
}
```

### 2. Service Factory

Implement a factory pattern to instantiate the appropriate client based on configuration:

```typescript
class GoogleAIServiceFactory {
  static createClient(config: ServiceConfig): GoogleAIClient<any, any> {
    switch (config.serviceType) {
      case 'gemini':
        return new GoogleGeminiClient(config);
      case 'vertex':
        return new VertexAIClient(config);
      case 'documentai':
        return new DocumentAIClient(config);
      // Additional cases for other services
      default:
        throw new Error(`Unsupported service type: ${config.serviceType}`);
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Key Management Enhancements

Extend the current key rotation mechanism to support service-specific keys:

```typescript
interface KeyConfig {
  serviceType: string;
  apiKey: string;
  quotaLimit: number;
  usageTracking: boolean;
}
```

### 4. Request Router

Create a smart router that directs requests to the most appropriate service based on the input type and current availability:

```typescript
class AIServiceRouter {
  private clients: Map<string, GoogleAIClient<any, any>[]> = new Map();
  
  route(request: AIRequest): Promise<AIResponse> {
    const serviceType = this.determineOptimalService(request);
    const client = this.getAvailableClient(serviceType);
    return client.process(request.input, request.options);
  }
  
  private determineOptimalService(request: AIRequest): string {
    // Logic to select the best service based on request type
  }
  
  private getAvailableClient(serviceType: string): GoogleAIClient<any, any> {
    // Logic to select an available client with quota remaining
  }
}
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Architecture Setup (2 weeks)

- Design and implement the common interface
- Create the service factory
- Enhance key management for multiple service types
- Implement the request router
- Update configuration handling for multiple services

### Phase 2: Vertex AI Integration (3 weeks)

- Implement the VertexAIClient
- Add support for Vertex AI models
- Create tests for the implementation
- Update documentation
- Deploy and monitor performance

### Phase 3: Document AI Integration (2 weeks)

- Implement the DocumentAIClient
- Add document processing endpoints to the API
- Create tests for document processing
- Update documentation
- Deploy and monitor performance

### Phase 4: Additional Services (4 weeks)

- Implement remaining service clients
- Add specialized endpoints for each service
- Create comprehensive tests
- Update documentation
- Deploy and monitor performance

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Development Costs

- Engineering time: Approximately 11 weeks of development
- Testing resources: Additional API usage during development
- Documentation and training: Time to create user guides

### Benefits

- **Expanded Capabilities**: Access to specialized AI services beyond text generation
- **Higher Throughput**: Ability to leverage multiple service quotas
- **Cost Optimization**: Maximize free tier usage across services
- **Reliability**: Fallback options if one service is unavailable
- **Unified Interface**: Consistent API for accessing diverse AI capabilities

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Implement service-specific usage tracking
- Create dashboards for quota monitoring
- Set up alerts for approaching limits
- Regularly update client implementations as APIs evolve
- Conduct periodic performance reviews

## Conclusion

Integrating additional Google AI services will significantly enhance the capabilities of Gemini Tumbler while maintaining our core benefits of key rotation and load balancing. By following this phased approach, we can systematically expand our platform's functionality while ensuring reliability and performance.

The implementation will prioritize services that offer the most value through their free tiers, allowing users to access a wide range of AI capabilities without incurring significant costs.
