## Introduction

SPARC-Bench is a sophisticated benchmarking system that evaluates SPARC2's performance using multiple benchmark types:

- **HumanEval**: Tests code generation accuracy and problem-solving capabilities
- **SWE-bench**: Evaluates software engineering tasks and code refactoring abilities
- **RedCode**: Focuses on security and safety aspects of code generation

The framework provides detailed metrics on accuracy, efficiency, safety, and adaptability, allowing you to optimize your SPARC2 agents for peak performance.

## Getting Started

To quickly get started with SPARC-Bench, refer to our [Quick Start Guide](./getting-started/quick-start.md). For a more detailed setup process, check the [Installation Guide](./getting-started/installation.md).

## Core Concepts

SPARC-Bench operates on several key concepts:

- **Benchmark Types**: Different categories of tests (HumanEval, SWE-bench, RedCode)
- **Test Cases**: Individual tests within each benchmark
- **Metrics**: Quantitative measurements of performance (accuracy, efficiency, safety, adaptability)
- **Benchmark Manager**: Coordinates the execution of benchmarks and collects results
- **E2B Integration**: Secure sandbox environment for code execution

For a deeper understanding of these concepts, see the [Core Concepts](./concepts/core-concepts.md) documentation.
