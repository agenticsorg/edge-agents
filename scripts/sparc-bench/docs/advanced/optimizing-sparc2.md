# Optimizing SPARC2 Agents

This guide provides advanced strategies for optimizing your SPARC2 agents based on benchmark results to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

## Understanding Optimization Dimensions

SPARC2 agents can be optimized along several dimensions:

1. **Accuracy**: How correctly the agent completes tasks
2. **Efficiency**: How quickly and resource-efficiently tasks are completed
3. **Safety**: How well security best practices are followed
4. **Adaptability**: How well the agent performs across different problem types

Each dimension requires different optimization strategies, and there are often trade-offs between them.

## Systematic Optimization Process

Follow this systematic process to optimize your SPARC2 agents:

### 1. Establish Baseline Performance

Before making any changes, establish a baseline performance:

```bash
deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env --allow-net run-sparc2-benchmark.ts
```

Save the results as your baseline:

```bash
cp results/all-benchmarks-*.json results/baseline.json
```

### 2. Identify Optimization Targets

Analyze the baseline results to identify the weakest areas:

```bash
deno run --allow-read --allow-write sparc-bench.ts analyze --input results/baseline.json
```

Look for:
- Test cases with the lowest pass rates
- Metrics with the lowest scores
- Performance bottlenecks (long execution times)

### 3. Implement Targeted Improvements

Based on your analysis, implement targeted improvements for each dimension:

#### Accuracy Optimization

If accuracy is low:

1. **Improve Prompt Engineering**:
   - Add more explicit instructions
   - Include examples of expected outputs
   - Specify formatting requirements clearly

2. **Enhance Context Management**:
   - Provide more relevant context
   - Organize context in a structured way
   - Prioritize the most important information

3. **Implement Verification Steps**:
   - Add self-verification steps in the prompt
   - Implement post-processing validation
   - Use multi-step reasoning

Example accuracy-optimized configuration:

```toml
[agent]
promptTemplate = """
You are a SPARC2 agent tasked with {task}.

Follow these steps:
1. Understand the requirements
2. Plan your approach
3. Implement the solution
4. Verify your solution against the requirements
5. Fix any issues found during verification

Examples of correct solutions:
{examples}

Format your response as follows:
```{language}
// Your code here
```
"""
```

#### Efficiency Optimization

If efficiency is low:

1. **Optimize Token Usage**:
   - Reduce prompt length
   - Use concise instructions
   - Remove unnecessary examples

2. **Implement Caching**:
   - Enable token caching
   - Cache common operations
   - Reuse results for similar queries

3. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Run independent tasks in parallel
   - Split large tasks into smaller chunks
   - Implement asynchronous processing

Example efficiency-optimized configuration:

```toml
[agent]
tokenCacheEnabled = true
maxParallelAgents = 4
promptTemplate = """
You are a SPARC2 agent. Task: {task}. Be concise.
"""

[execution]
processing = "parallel"
maxConcurrent = 4
```

#### Safety Optimization

If safety is low:

1. **Implement Security Guardrails**:
   - Add security-focused instructions
   - Include examples of secure code
   - Specify security requirements

2. **Security Validation**:
   - Implement post-processing security checks
   - Validate inputs and outputs
   - Scan for common vulnerabilities

3. **Restricted Execution**:
   - Limit available operations
   - Use sandboxed environments
   - Implement permission controls

Example safety-optimized configuration:

```toml
[agent]
promptTemplate = """
You are a SPARC2 agent tasked with {task}.

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Validate all inputs
- Escape user-provided data
- Use parameterized queries for databases
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Do not include sensitive information in logs or comments

Examples of secure code:
{securityExamples}
"""

[security]
level = "strict"
scanForVulnerabilities = true
```

#### Adaptability Optimization

If adaptability is low:

1. **Diverse Training**:
   - Expose the agent to diverse problem types
   - Include examples from different domains
   - Vary the complexity of tasks

2. **Meta-Learning Techniques**:
   - Implement few-shot learning
   - Use chain-of-thought reasoning
   - Apply transfer learning principles

3. **Dynamic Configuration**:
   - Adjust parameters based on task type
   - Use different prompts for different domains
   - Implement task-specific optimizations

Example adaptability-optimized configuration:

```toml
[agent]
promptTemplate = """
You are a versatile SPARC2 agent capable of handling diverse tasks.

Current task type: {taskType}
Task description: {task}

Approach this task by:
1. Identifying the domain (programming, math, text, etc.)
2. Recalling relevant patterns from similar problems
3. Adapting those patterns to this specific task
4. Implementing a solution that follows best practices for the domain

Examples from various domains:
{diverseExamples}
"""
```

### 4. Measure Improvement

After implementing changes, run the benchmarks again:

```bash
deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env --allow-net run-sparc2-benchmark.ts
```

Compare with the baseline:

```bash
deno run --allow-read --allow-write sparc-bench.ts analyze --input results/all-benchmarks-*.json --compare results/baseline.json
```

### 5. Iterate and Refine

Optimization is an iterative process:

1. Implement one change at a time
2. Measure the impact
3. Keep changes that improve performance
4. Revert changes that degrade performance
5. Repeat until you reach your performance goals

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### Prompt Engineering Techniques

#### Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Encourage step-by-step reasoning:

```
Think through this problem step by step:
1. First, understand what the problem is asking
2. Break down the problem into smaller parts
3. Solve each part individually
4. Combine the solutions
5. Verify the final answer
```

#### Few-Shot Learning

Provide examples of similar problems:

```
Example 1:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Expected output: 15
Solution: return array.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);

Example 2:
Input: [10, 20, 30]
Expected output: 60
Solution: return array.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);

Now solve:
Input: [7, 8, 9]
```

#### Self-Consistency

Ask the agent to generate multiple solutions and select the best one:

```
Generate three different solutions to this problem.
Evaluate the pros and cons of each solution.
Select the best solution based on correctness, efficiency, and readability.
```

### Hyperparameter Optimization

Systematically explore different hyperparameter combinations:

1. **Grid Search**: Test all combinations of a predefined set of hyperparameters
2. **Random Search**: Test random combinations within a range
3. **Bayesian Optimization**: Use probabilistic models to guide the search

Example hyperparameter optimization script:

```typescript
// hyperparameter-optimization.ts
import { BenchmarkManager } from "./src/benchmarks/benchmark-manager.ts";
import { sparc2HumanEvalBenchmark } from "./samples/sparc2-benchmark.ts";

const hyperparameters = {
  temperature: [0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0],
  maxTokens: [1024, 2048, 4096],
  topP: [0.9, 0.95, 1.0],
};

async function optimizeHyperparameters() {
  const benchmarkManager = new BenchmarkManager();
  benchmarkManager.registerBenchmark(sparc2HumanEvalBenchmark);
  
  let bestConfig = null;
  let bestScore = 0;
  
  // Grid search
  for (const temperature of hyperparameters.temperature) {
    for (const maxTokens of hyperparameters.maxTokens) {
      for (const topP of hyperparameters.topP) {
        // Set hyperparameters
        const config = { temperature, maxTokens, topP };
        console.log(`Testing config: ${JSON.stringify(config)}`);
        
        // Run benchmark with this configuration
        const result = await benchmarkManager.runBenchmark("sparc2-code-analysis", { config });
        
        // Calculate overall score
        const score = result.metrics.accuracy * 0.4 + 
                      result.metrics.efficiency * 0.2 + 
                      result.metrics.safety * 0.3 + 
                      result.metrics.adaptability * 0.1;
        
        console.log(`Score: ${score}`);
        
        // Update best configuration
        if (score > bestScore) {
          bestScore = score;
          bestConfig = config;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  console.log(`Best configuration: ${JSON.stringify(bestConfig)}`);
  console.log(`Best score: ${bestScore}`);
  
  return bestConfig;
}

optimizeHyperparameters().catch(console.error);
```

### Multi-Agent Systems

Combine multiple specialized agents for better performance:

1. **Router Agent**: Determines which specialized agent to use
2. **Specialized Agents**: Optimized for specific tasks
3. **Aggregator Agent**: Combines and refines results

Example multi-agent configuration:

```toml
[multiAgent]
enabled = true

[multiAgent.router]
promptTemplate = """
You are a router agent. Analyze the task and determine which specialized agent should handle it.
Task: {task}
Available agents: coding, math, text, security
"""

[multiAgent.agents.coding]
promptTemplate = """
You are a coding specialist. Implement the solution for this programming task.
Task: {task}
"""

[multiAgent.agents.math]
promptTemplate = """
You are a math specialist. Solve this mathematical problem.
Task: {task}
"""

[multiAgent.aggregator]
promptTemplate = """
You are an aggregator agent. Review and refine the solution provided by the specialized agent.
Task: {task}
Specialized agent solution: {solution}
"""
```

## Balancing Trade-offs

Optimization often involves trade-offs between different metrics:

- **Accuracy vs. Efficiency**: Higher accuracy may require more computation
- **Safety vs. Adaptability**: Stricter safety measures may limit adaptability
- **Specialization vs. Generalization**: Specialized agents perform better on specific tasks but worse on others

To balance these trade-offs:

1. **Define Priorities**: Determine which metrics are most important for your use case
2. **Weight Metrics**: Assign weights to each metric based on priorities
3. **Set Thresholds**: Define minimum acceptable values for each metric
4. **Optimize Holistically**: Consider the overall performance across all metrics

Example weighted scoring function:

```typescript
function calculateOverallScore(result: BenchmarkResult, weights: Record<string, number>): number {
  return (
    result.metrics.accuracy * (weights.accuracy || 0.25) +
    result.metrics.efficiency * (weights.efficiency || 0.25) +
    result.metrics.safety * (weights.safety || 0.25) +
    result.metrics.adaptability * (weights.adaptability || 0.25)
  );
}
```

## Continuous Optimization

Optimization is an ongoing process:

1. **Automated Benchmarking**: Run benchmarks automatically on a schedule
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Track performance metrics over time
3. **Regression Testing**: Ensure new optimizations don't break existing functionality
4. **Feedback Loop**: Incorporate user feedback into optimization efforts

Example continuous optimization workflow:

```bash
# Daily benchmarking script
#!/bin/bash
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
cd /path/to/sparc-bench
deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env --allow-net run-sparc2-benchmark.ts
cp results/all-benchmarks-*.json results/daily/$DATE.json
deno run --allow-read --allow-write sparc-bench.ts analyze --input results/daily/$DATE.json --compare results/daily/$(date -d "yesterday" +%Y-%m-%d).json
```

## Conclusion

Optimizing SPARC2 agents is a complex but rewarding process. By systematically analyzing benchmark results, implementing targeted improvements, and continuously refining your approach, you can achieve state-of-the-art performance across all metrics.

Remember that optimization is not a one-time effort but an ongoing process of measurement, improvement, and validation. Use the tools and techniques in this guide to continuously enhance your SPARC2 agents and stay at the cutting edge of performance.
