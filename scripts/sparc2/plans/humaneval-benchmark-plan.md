# SPARC2 HumanEval Benchmark Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to benchmark and optimize the SPARC2 agent system using the HumanEval dataset. The goal is to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for agentic code development and provide detailed results to validate our claims.

## Objectives

1. Establish a baseline performance of SPARC2 on the HumanEval benchmark
2. Identify key areas for optimization
3. Implement and test optimizations in a systematic manner
4. Document performance improvements and methodologies
5. Achieve SOTA results compared to existing systems

## Benchmark Methodology

### Dataset

- **HumanEval**: A collection of 164 hand-written programming problems designed to test code generation capabilities
- Each problem includes:
  - A function signature
  - A docstring describing the function's purpose
  - Test cases to verify correctness
  - A canonical solution

### Metrics

- **Primary Metric**: pass@k (especially pass@1)
- **Secondary Metrics**:
  - Execution time
  - Token usage efficiency
  - Error analysis
  - Code quality assessment

### Optimization Phases

The optimization process will be conducted in four sequential phases:

1. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Test various prompt templates and instructions
   - Optimize context window usage
   - Incorporate examples and few-shot learning techniques

2. **Architecture Enhancements**
   - Improve code parsing and analysis
   - Enhance error detection and self-correction mechanisms
   - Optimize the SPARC methodology implementation

3. **Model Selection and Configuration**
   - Test different LLM models (GPT-4o, Claude-3-Opus, Gemini-1.5-Pro)
   - Optimize temperature and other sampling parameters
   - Evaluate token usage and performance tradeoffs

4. **Execution Environment Optimization**
   - Enhance test execution and validation
   - Optimize resource allocation
   - Implement execution caching for improved performance

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Baseline

1. Configure the benchmark environment
2. Run initial tests with default SPARC2 configuration
3. Document baseline performance
4. Analyze failure cases and identify optimization opportunities

### Phase 2: Iterative Optimization

For each optimization phase:

1. Implement changes to the specified component
2. Run benchmark tests with the new configuration
3. Document performance changes
4. Retain the best-performing configuration for the next phase

### Phase 3: Final Evaluation and Documentation

1. Run comprehensive benchmark with the optimized configuration
2. Compare results with baseline and other state-of-the-art systems
3. Document detailed findings in `/sparc2/benchmark/results.md`
4. Prepare visualization of performance improvements

## Execution Timeline

1. **Day 1**: Setup and baseline evaluation
2. **Day 2-3**: Prompt engineering optimization
3. **Day 4-5**: Architecture enhancements
4. **Day 6-7**: Model selection and configuration
5. **Day 8-9**: Execution environment optimization
6. **Day 10**: Final evaluation and documentation

## Success Criteria

- Achieve pass@1 score exceeding current SOTA systems
- Document comprehensive optimization methodology
- Provide detailed analysis of performance characteristics
- Create reproducible benchmark process

## Reporting

All benchmark results will be documented in `/sparc2/benchmark/results.md` with:

- Detailed performance metrics
- Comparison with baseline and other systems
- Analysis of optimization impact
- Recommendations for future improvements

This plan provides a structured approach to benchmarking and optimizing SPARC2 using the HumanEval dataset, with the goal of achieving and documenting state-of-the-art performance for agentic code development.
