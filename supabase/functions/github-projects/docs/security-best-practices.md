# GitHub Projects API Security Best Practices

This document outlines security best practices for the GitHub Projects API integration edge function to ensure robust protection of your GitHub data, tokens, and organization assets.

## Token Security

### Personal Access Token Protection

The GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) is the primary authentication mechanism for this integration. Protecting this token is critical:

1. **Never expose the token in client-side code or version control**
   - Always store the token as an environment variable
   - Include `.env` in your `.gitignore` file
   - Use environment variable templates (`.env.example`) without real values

2. **Use the principle of least privilege**
   - Create tokens with the minimum required permissions
   - For read-only operations, use read-only scopes
   - Consider creating separate tokens for different environments (dev, staging, production)

3. **Regularly rotate tokens**
   - Implement a token rotation schedule (e.g., every 90 days)
   - Update tokens immediately when team members with token access leave

4. **Monitor token usage**
   - Regularly review GitHub audit logs for token usage
   - Enable notifications for suspicious activity

### Token Exposure Remediation

If a token is accidentally exposed:

1. Delete the compromised token immediately in GitHub
2. Create a new token with appropriate permissions
3. Update the environment variable in Supabase
4. Review audit logs for any unauthorized access or activities
5. Scan repositories for any data that might have been exposed

## Webhook Security

### Webhook Signature Validation

The GitHub webhook implementation includes signature validation to prevent spoofing:

1. **Always use a strong webhook secret**
   - Generate using a secure method (e.g., `openssl rand -hex 20`)
   - Store as an environment variable alongside the GitHub token

2. **Validate every webhook request**
   - Never skip signature validation in any environment
   - Reject requests with missing or invalid signatures

3. **Use constant-time comparison**
   - The implementation uses crypto APIs that prevent timing attacks

### Webhook Configuration Best Practices

1. **Limit webhook events**
   - Only subscribe to events your application needs
   - Be selective about repositories included in webhook configurations

2. **Use TLS for webhook endpoints**
   - Always use HTTPS for webhook URLs
   - Enable SSL verification in GitHub webhook settings

3. **Implement event validation logic**
   - Validate the structure and content of webhook payloads
   - Reject malformed or unexpected events

## Rate Limiting

### Rate Limit Handling

GitHub API has strict rate limits. The API integration includes rate limit handling:

1. **Respect GitHub's rate limits**
   - The integration forwards rate limit headers
   - Implement exponential backoff for retries when limits are reached

2. **Optimize request frequency**
   - Utilize the built-in caching mechanism (`CACHE_TTL` environment variable)
   - Batch API operations when possible

3. **Monitor rate limit consumption**
   - Track remaining requests via response metadata
   - Set up alerts when approaching rate limits

### Mitigating Rate Limit Issues

1. **Increase cache duration**
   - Adjust `CACHE_TTL` based on how frequently data changes
   - Use longer cache times for relatively static data

2. **Implement client-side caching**
   - Store responses on the client side when appropriate
   - Utilize conditional requests with ETag headers

3. **Consider GitHub Enterprise API**
   - For high-volume applications, consider GitHub Enterprise
   - Higher rate limits are available for enterprise accounts

## Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Handling

1. **Avoid storing sensitive GitHub data**
   - Don't persist sensitive data from GitHub in your database
   - If storage is necessary, encrypt sensitive fields

2. **Sanitize error messages**
   - The error handler removes sensitive information
   - Custom error responses prevent information leakage

3. **Validate input data**
   - All input is validated before processing
   - Prevent injection attacks through thorough validation

### CORS Configuration

The edge function includes CORS headers configuration:

1. **Restrict CORS to trusted domains**
   - Update the CORS configuration in `../_shared/cors.ts`
   - Explicitly list allowed origins instead of allowing all domains

2. **Limit allowed HTTP methods**
   - Only allow necessary HTTP methods
   - Use pre-flight requests to validate complex requests

## Authentication and Authorization

### Client Authentication

The GitHub API edge function should be protected:

1. **Use Supabase Authentication**
   - Require authentication for accessing the edge function
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) via Supabase policies

2. **Implement API key validation**
   - Consider requiring API keys for internal services
   - Validate the source of requests

3. **Log authentication events**
   - Track authentication attempts and failures
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities

### Authorization Checks

1. **Implement resource-based authorization**
   - Check if the user has access to specific projects
   - Validate permissions before performing operations

2. **Audit authorization events**
   - Log authorization decisions
   - Review logs regularly

## Network Security

### TLS/SSL Configuration

1. **Enforce HTTPS**
   - Supabase edge functions use HTTPS by default
   - Redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS if custom domains are used

2. **Keep TLS configuration updated**
   - Use modern TLS versions (TLS 1.2+)
   - Regularly update SSL certificates

### Firewall and Access Controls

1. **Restrict access by IP if possible**
   - If the API is for internal use, consider IP restrictions
   - Use Supabase's Network Restrictions feature

2. **Implement request throttling**
   - Limit requests per client
   - Prevent potential DoS attacks

## Monitoring and Incident Response

### Logging and Monitoring

1. **Enable comprehensive logging**
   - Log all API requests and responses
   - Include request IDs for traceability

2. **Set up monitoring**
   - Monitor response times and error rates
   - Set up alerts for unusual patterns

3. **Regular security reviews**
   - Conduct periodic security assessments
   - Review permissions and access controls quarterly

### Incident Response

1. **Prepare an incident response plan**
   - Document steps to take in case of a security breach
   - Include contact information for responsible team members

2. **Practice incident scenarios**
   - Run tabletop exercises for security incidents
   - Update procedures based on learnings

## Compliance Considerations

### GitHub Data Usage Compliance

1. **Respect GitHub's Terms of Service**
   - Ensure your use of GitHub data complies with their terms
   - Be aware of rate limits and usage restrictions

2. **Implement data retention policies**
   - Only retain GitHub data for as long as necessary
   - Implement data purging mechanisms

3. **Consider regulatory requirements**
   - If your organization is subject to regulations like GDPR or CCPA
   - Implement necessary data protection measures
