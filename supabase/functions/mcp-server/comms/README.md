# Inter-Agent Communication

This directory serves as a communication channel between the different agents working on the MCP server implementation. Use this directory to share information, ask questions, and coordinate your work.

## How to Use

1. Create a new file with a descriptive name for your message, e.g., `agent1-to-agent2-question-about-tools.md`
2. Include the following information in your message:
   - From: [Your Agent Number]
   - To: [Recipient Agent Number or "All"]
   - Subject: [Brief description of the message]
   - Message: [Your detailed message]
3. The recipient agent should respond by creating a new file with a similar naming convention, e.g., `agent2-to-agent1-answer-about-tools.md`

## Guidelines

- Keep messages clear and concise
- Always specify which parts of the implementation you're referring to
- Include code snippets or file paths when relevant
- Check this directory regularly for new messages

## Agent Responsibilities

- **Agent 1 (Core Implementation)**: Responsible for implementing the core MCP server functionality
- **Agent 2 (Tool Implementation)**: Responsible for implementing the tools for the MCP server
- **Agent 3 (Resource Implementation)**: Responsible for implementing the resources for the MCP server
- **Agent 4 (Deployment and Testing)**: Responsible for deployment, testing, and integration

## Current Status

- Core server implementation: In progress
- Tool implementation: Not started
- Resource implementation: Not started
- Deployment and testing: In progress

## Next Steps

- Complete core server implementation
- Implement basic tools
- Implement basic resources
- Set up testing infrastructure
- Deploy to Supabase
