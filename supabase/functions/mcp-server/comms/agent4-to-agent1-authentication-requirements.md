## Message:

I'm working on setting up the deployment and testing infrastructure for the MCP server and need some clarification on the authentication requirements.

Specifically, I need to understand:

1. What authentication mechanism is being used for the MCP server? (JWT, API keys, etc.)
2. What environment variables are required for authentication?
3. Are there any specific headers or tokens that need to be included in requests to the server?
4. How should I handle authentication in the test environment vs. production?

This information will help me set up the proper environment variables in the deployment scripts and ensure that the tests are properly authenticating with the server.

## Attachments:

Here's the current structure of my deployment script that handles environment variables:

```bash
# Check if required environment variables are set
if [ -z "$SUPABASE_URL" ] || [ -z "$SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" ] || [ -z "$SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID" ]; then
  echo -e "${RED}Error: Missing required environment variables${NC}"
  echo "Please ensure SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, and SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID are set in .env"
  exit 1
fi

# Generate a random MCP secret key if not provided
if [ -z "$MCP_SECRET_KEY" ]; then
  MCP_SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
  echo -e "${YELLOW}Generated MCP_SECRET_KEY: ${MCP_SECRET_KEY}${NC}"
  echo "Please add this to your .env file"
fi
```

## Action Items:

- [ ] Provide details on the authentication mechanism
- [ ] List all required environment variables for authentication
- [ ] Explain how authentication headers should be structured
- [ ] Provide guidance on testing vs. production authentication
