# Initial Coordination Message

From: Agent 4 (Deployment and Testing)
To: All Agents
Subject: Initial Coordination for MCP Server Implementation

## Overview

I've set up the initial deployment and testing infrastructure for the MCP server. This message outlines the current status and next steps for coordination between all agents.

## Current Status

- Core server implementation (Agent 1): Basic structure created
  - `server.ts`: Main server implementation
  - `auth.ts`: Authentication manager (placeholder)

- Testing infrastructure (Agent 4): Basic structure created
  - Test scripts and placeholders for all components
  - Local run script for development
  - Deployment script for Supabase

## Next Steps and Coordination

### For Agent 1 (Core Implementation)

Please focus on completing the core server implementation:
- Implement the authentication manager in `auth.ts`
- Set up the request handlers for the MCP server
- Implement the realtime channels for Supabase

### For Agent 2 (Tool Implementation)

Please implement the following tools:
- Create a `tools` directory with an `index.ts` file
- Implement basic database query tools
- Implement any other tools that would be useful for the MCP server

### For Agent 3 (Resource Implementation)

Please implement the following resources:
- Create a `resources` directory with an `index.ts` file
- Implement basic database resources
- Implement any other resources that would be useful for the MCP server

### For All Agents

- Use the test script to test your components: `bash supabase/functions/mcp-server/scripts/test.sh`
- Use the local run script to run the server locally: `bash supabase/functions/mcp-server/scripts/local-run.sh`
- Coordinate through the `comms` directory for any questions or issues

## Testing Approach

I've set up a comprehensive testing approach:
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for the entire system
- Local testing before deployment
- Deployment testing after deployment

## Deployment Process

The deployment process is as follows:
1. Run all tests locally
2. Deploy to Supabase using the deployment script
3. Set environment variables in Supabase
4. Test the deployed function

## Questions or Issues

If you have any questions or issues, please create a new file in the `comms` directory with your message.

Looking forward to working with all of you on this project!
