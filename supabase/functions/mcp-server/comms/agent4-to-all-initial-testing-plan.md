# Initial Testing Plan

From: Agent 4 (Deployment and Testing)
To: All
Subject: Initial Testing Plan

## Overview

I've set up the testing infrastructure for the MCP server. This message outlines the testing approach and what I'll need from each agent to ensure comprehensive test coverage.

## Testing Approach

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing how components work together
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Testing the complete flow from request to response

## What I Need from Each Agent

### Agent 1 (Core Implementation)

- Documentation on the core server API and interfaces
- Any mock objects or test helpers you've created
- Key scenarios that should be tested for the core server

### Agent 2 (Tool Implementation)

- List of all tools being implemented
- Expected input/output for each tool
- Edge cases that should be tested

### Agent 3 (Resource Implementation)

- List of all resources being implemented
- Expected input/output for each resource
- Edge cases that should be tested

## Next Steps

1. I'll create test files for each component based on your input
2. We'll run the tests locally to ensure everything works
3. I'll set up the deployment pipeline to run tests automatically
4. We'll deploy to Supabase and verify functionality

Please respond with the requested information so I can proceed with creating comprehensive tests. If you have any questions or suggestions about the testing approach, please let me know.
